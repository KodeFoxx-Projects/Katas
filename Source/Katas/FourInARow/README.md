## "Four In A Row" Problem Description
The game "[Four In A Row](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)" (also known as "Connect Four", Ã©Four Up", "Four in a Line", "Gravitrips" and more...)  is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves. The game was first sold under the Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
